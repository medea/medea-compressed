## Installation

```
npm install medea-compressed
```

## Example

### Input

```javascript
var medea = require('medea')

  , db = require('./medea-compressed')(medea())
  , input = 'Hej hopp'

// all functions from medea ar available
db.open(function () {
  db.put('beep', input, function (err) {
    db.get('beep', function (err, data) {
      console.log('input', input)
      console.log('db.get()', data.toString())
    })
  })
})
```

### Output

```
input Hej hopp
db.get() Hej hopp
```

## Usage

### medeaCompressed(db)

Wrap an existing medea-instance

### .put(key, value, callback)

__db.put__ will save the value in the database - similarly to hos medea works.

The difference is that the `value` _might_ get compressed. If the compressed size is smaller than the original size it's saved compressed, otherwise it's saved raw.

### .get(key, callback)

__db.get__ will read the value from the database.

If the value is compressed the value will be decompressed before being returned. medeaDown looks for the gzip-header to figure out if the value has been gzipped or not.

### .close, .remove, .createSnapshot, .compact

These methods will forward the the arguments to medea-instance.
